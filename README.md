'''
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings.

The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. 

For example, the string 


```python
AAAABBBCCDAA 
AABBAABBAABB
aabbccdddcbbbbaabbc
```
    
would be encoded as 
    
 ```ruby
 4A3B2C1D2A
 2A2B2A2B2A2B
 2a2b2c3d1c4b2a2b1c
 ```

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. 
You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters.
You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.
